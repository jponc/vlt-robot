== Caveat

This is the VLT robot app. I created my own session for this app, I know this is a bit unsecure. But for the sake of having a current user, I added a simple login/signup.

== App

The robot has the ability to move in a 5x5 grid table.

== Tech stack

- Ruby on Rails (as API)
- BackboneJS
- CoffeeScript
- SCSS + Simple Bootstrap
- Postgresql
- RSpec with Mocha
- Heroku (I normally use DigitalOcean, but since Heroku offers free hosting.. why not!)
